# Access server in WSL through Windows network

1. Open a hotspot in Windows

2. Add a proxy in Windows to access WSL deployed apps through Windows localhost

    In powershell execute the following command:

    ```
    netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=4000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=8080 connectaddress=192.168.1.4
    ```

    - listenport: the port external devices will connect to
    - connectport: the port where our application server is configured to listen inside WSL
    - connectaddress: IP address given to WSL. To get this IP address get `inet` of `eht0` through `ifconfig`

3. Open port (listenport) in Windows firewall

4. Get the access url to use in devices connected to Windows hotspot

    ipconfig and get ip address. Example: 
    ```
    http://192.168.137.1:4000/test
    ```
